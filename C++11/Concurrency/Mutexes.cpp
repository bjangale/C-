/**
 *
 * Mutexes : Mutexes are used to prevent data races by ensuring that only one thread can access critical
 *         section of code at a time.
 * 1. std::mutex mtx;
 *    mtx.lock()      - locks the mutex if available.if locked calling thread owns the mutex until it
 *                      calls unlock()
 *    mtx.unlock()    - unlocks the mutex.
 *    mtx.try_lock()  - try to locks the mutex, return true if locked successfully false otherwise
 *    mtx.native_handle() - return platform-specific native handle.
 *
 * 2. std::timed_mutex tmtx;
 *   tmtx.lock()     - locks the mutex, blocks if the mutex is not available
 *   tmtx.try_lock() - tries to lock the mutex, returns if the mutex is not available
 *   tmtx.try_lock_for() - tries to lock the mutex, returns if the mutex has been
 *                        unavailable for the specified timeout duration
 *   tmtx.try_lock_until() - tries to lock the mutex, returns if the mutex has been
 *                           unavailable until specified time point has been reached
 *   tmtx.unlock()       - unlocks the mutex
 *
 * 3. std::recursive_mutex - allows same thread to lock the mutex multiple times.
 *
 * 4. std::lock_guard<std::mutex> guard(mtx)
 *                   - RAII style mechanism for owning a mutex for duration of scoped block.
 *                     provides convinient way to lock and unlock mutex automatically.

 *
 * 7. std::unique_lock<std::mutex>
 *                   - unique_lock provides more flexlibility such as differed locking,
 *                     time locking, manual unlocking.
 *   lock
 *  	locks (i.e., takes ownership of) the associated mutex
 *
 *   try_lock
 *	    tries to lock (i.e., takes ownership of) the associated mutex without blocking
 *
 *   try_lock_for
 *	    attempts to lock (i.e., takes ownership of) the associated TimedLockable mutex, returns
 *	    if the mutex has been unavailable for the specified time duration
 *
 *   try_lock_until
 *	    tries to lock (i.e., takes ownership of) the associated TimedLockable mutex, returns if
 *	    the mutex has been unavailable until specified time point has been reached
 *
 *   unlock
 *	    unlocks (i.e., releases ownership of) the associated mutex
 *
 * Modifiers:
 *   swap
 *	    swaps state with another std::unique_lock
 *   release
 *	    disassociates the associated mutex without unlocking (i.e., releasing ownership of) it
 *   Observers:
 *   mutex
 *	    returns a pointer to the associated mutex
 *   owns_lock
 *	    tests whether the lock owns (i.e., has locked) its associated mutex

/**
 * std::defer_lock is a tag type used with std::unique_lock and std::lock_guard to
